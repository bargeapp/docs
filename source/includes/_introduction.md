# Introduction

## What is Barge?

Barge is the only platform that uses existing functional tests to load test your application.

## Supported Frameworks

At the moment Barge supports PhantomJS and CasperJS written in JavaScript or CoffeeScript. If you'd like to see Barge support another framework please let us know by emailing us at <a href="mailto:hello@bargeapp.com">hello@bargeapp.com</a>.

## Pricing
We plan to charge per operation but are allowing a limited number of users run a limited number of tests for free during our beta.
